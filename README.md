# Datasets Used for Analyzing and Manipulating Metadata in L01 & AFF4-L

This repository contains datasets and supplementary materials used for verifying and manipulating metadata in logical image formats. The primary focus is on identifying and manipulating the metadata of L01 and AFF4-L formats to evaluate their integrity and originality.

The datasets in this repository were used to conduct tests for the paper titled "Revisiting Logical Image Formats for Future Digital Forensics: A Comprehensive Analysis on L01 and AFF4-L." This paper has been submitted to DFRWS APAC 2024 and is planned to be made publicly available in the near future.
